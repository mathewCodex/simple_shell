# 0x16. C - SIMPLE SHELL


### Task 0: Betty Would Be Proud
- Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks

### Task 1: Simple shell 0.1
Write a UNIX command line interpreter.
-   Usage: simple_shell
-   Your Shell should:
Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
-   The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
-   The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
-   The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
-   If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
-   Handle errors.
-   You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D) <br/>
You don’t have to:
-   use the PATH
-   implement built-ins
-   handle special characters : ", ', `, \, *, &, #
-   be able to move the cursor
-   handle commands with arguments
